# Best Practices (assessment-checklists)

## Example Script
Use `scripts/pre_submit_check.sh` to print timeboxing prompts before final push.

## How To Apply
- Run the script at T-60, T-30, T-10 checkpoints.
- Record results in `docs/pre-submit-checklist.md` if available.

## Notes
- Keep the script read-only; it should not modify repo state.
